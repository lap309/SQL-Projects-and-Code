# Campaign-Business-Report
This report is centered around a fundraising platform for creative projects of all tyypes and size. It operates through a crowdfunding model, by having people make donations online. The model is a little unique in that it follows an all or nothing model. If the project does not meet it's budget goal, then the project will not launch, donors receive a reimbursement for the amount they donated, and the project receives ZERO funding.<br>
<br>
The steps involved in setting up a campaign are as follows:<br>
- A creator registers a new project online with a budget goal and the numer of days it will be open to receive donations <br>
- People can donate online to whatever projects they like <br>
- If the budget goal is met, the project receives the money, otherwise they receive nothing

This analysis gives further insight into the performance and behavior of the donors for the fundraising company to deduce a strategy or what to expect when people want to create a new fundraising project.
